This lesson is an introduction to programming Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience
using analysis of tabular data as a motivating example. It is designed to be used for self-paced study or as a reference for a one day workshop.
It references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
