* Misc Notes


** TODO Random function/Library.  
** TODO Googling functions. Exercise or Demonstrate. 
** TODO Exercises involving classes/library and going to google.
** TODO Using stack overflow for code trouble shooting. 
** TODO Google? Show how to google error messages.
** TODO Basic print debugging.
** TODO TODO Problem solving.
** TODO Pseudocode.
**** TODO Decide on a generic pseudocode syntax to use.
** TODO Classes.
Discuss this and make sure everyone understands. Use “super object” analogy to reference the intro analogy made about objects.

Exercises using pseudocode and problem solving to implement functions, loops and conditionals.
** Libraries
*** TODO 
** Lists and indexing 
*** Lists are like locker rooms where each locker stores at most one value. 
*** 

* Lesson Notes 
** Running and Quiting: 
*** .py extension is not mandatory ie. is for humans. 
*** Benefits of using a notebook. 
*** Key shortcuts. 
**** Esc Control mode. 
***** Try some stuff. 
***** A New cell Above. 
***** B New cell below. 
***** X Delete cell. 
**** Ret Edit mode. 
***** Ret adds other lines to code. 
***** Shift + Ret Executes cell. 
*** Rendering markdown with notebooks. 
***** A simplified format that allows us to write documents that will look like webpages. 
***** We can access markdown mode by pressing M in control mode. 
***** Go back to code mode by pressing Y in control mode. 
**** Examples  
***** L1 Header and L2. 
***** Unordered List. 
***** Ordered list. 
***** Links 
***** Named Links 
** Variables and Assignment 
*** = operator. 
*** Allowed variable names. 
**** Cant start with digit. 
**** cant contain spaces, ' marks or other punct except. 
**** underscore ie. used to seperate words in var name. 
**** underscores at start have a special purpose which we wont cover in less. 
*** print function. 
**** displays things. 
**** Used for print debugging. 
*** we call the print function ie. pokemon analogy. 
**** Variables persist between cells once executed. Illustrate this. 
**** Variables must be declared. 
*** last line of error message usually the most usefull. 
**** Python case sensistive. 
***** we recommend using lower case with underscores even though there are many naming conventions. 
**** Use meaningful variable names.
***** Consider your future self 
***** Audience. 
**** Variables can be used in calculations. 
**** Swapping values exercise. 
** Data types and type conversion 
*** Every value has a type. 
**** ints, floats and strings. 
**** type function. Used to determine type of whats stored in variables(not var itself)  
**** type determines operations that can be performed on values. 
***** ints can be subtracted but not stings. 
***** eg. strings can be added and multiplied but has different effect. 
***** Strings have length but not int and floats
***** Must convert types to perform some operations on them. 
***** basic type conversion. 
***** can mix ints and floats freely in ops. 
***** Unlike spreadsheet cells. vars only change value when changed directly.  
** Built in functions and help 
*** What's an argument. 
*** Different functions take different numbers of argumensts 
**** Always use parenthesis even when zero arguments. 
*** min, max and round. 
**** min and max work on strings. 
*** However, functions may only contain certain(combinations of) arguments. 
**** len cant take in. 
**** max and min must have at least one argument. 
*** Some functions have default argument values. 
**** round with 1 value rounds to 0 decimal places. 
*** How do we find this information out?
**** help(function_name)
**** two additional ways in jupyter. 
***** shift - tab in parenthesis of function. 
***** function_name?
*** Every function returns something 
**** None is what it returns when it has nothing useful to return. 
** Error messages. 
*** Comments. 
*** Sytax errors cause. 
*** Sometimes python gives us line numbers with errors. 
*** Reading an error message ipython 
*** U dont have to know all error messages. 
**** stack overflow. 
**** google. 
*** Indentation error
